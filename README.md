## Phase 1a
**twitterAPI_tests.py** contains various functions that interact with Twitter API v2 endpoints. Tested were a function to get a user's unique id from there username (in order to easily use usernames when querying data from specific users), function to retreive a specified number of a user's tweets (to use for specific user sentiment analysis), a function to search through recent tweets based on a specific parameter, and a way to get the tweets liked by a specific user. The main function provides examples of calling each function.  

Tokens are stored in a .env file.
